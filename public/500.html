    <h1>Whoops!</h1>

    <p>An unexpected error occurred. We're sorry! It's nothing you
      did!  The system maintainer has been notified by email.</p>

    <P>If you log out and then log back in, everything should be just
      fine. (And if you had just clicked the Pay button to buy tickets, that
      will let you quickly check your account to see if the
      purchase went through before trying to repeat it, to avoid a 
      duplicate charge.)</p>

    <p>You'll be taken back to the login page in a few seconds, or else you can
      <a href="/customers/logout">click here</a> to go there now.</p>
