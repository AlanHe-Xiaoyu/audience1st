\subsection{Referential Integrity}
\label{sec:integrity}

In order to maintain referential integrity of the database, deletion
actions tend to be destructive and should be used with great care:

\begin{itemize}
\item Deleting a customer record deletes \emph{all} vouchers associated
  with that customer, whether holding a reservation or not.
\item Deleting a voucher type or bundle type silently removes
  \emph{all} vouchers of that type from the accounts of patrons who hold
  them. 
\item Deleting a performance removes \emph{all} reservations to that
  performance.
\end{itemize}
