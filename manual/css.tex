\section{CSS Designer's Guide}
\label{sec:creating_css}

This section is provided for designers familiar with the Cascading
Stylesheets (CSS) standard for visual design of Web pages.  It contains
the necessary information to style the \af pages to match a venue's
existing Web site.

(Section TBD)

\subsection{External Resources}

Any images or other resources used by the CSS must be  hosted on the
venue's own (or another external) Web site, and fully-qualified URL's
must be used to name them.  (The URL of the main stylesheet itself is
settable as a configuration option of \af; see
section~\ref{sec:config-vars}.)
