\section{External Integration}
\label{sec:external-integration}

\af is designed to integrate with external/existing Web sites in various
ways described in this section.

\subsection{Warning: Don't Use IFrames}
\label{sec:iframes}

An IFrame is an HTML construct that allows you to display content from a
third-party site within a ``frame'' served from your main Web site.

\textbf{Do not attempt to embed Audience1st into your venue's primary
  web page using IFrames.}  The reason is that most browsers are
configured not to honor so-called ``browser cookies'' from sites
rendered within an IFrame, yet without cookies it's impossible for a
patron (or administrator) to login to \af.

Instead, customize \af's look and feel using the CSS hooks provided, as
described in section~\ref{sec:creating_css}.

\subsection{Linking Into Audience1st}
\label{sec:linking}

You can place various kinds of links directly on your own Web site to
take patrons to \af pages with preselected choices.  In the following
table, all URL's shown are \emph{relative} to the path
\url{http://www.audience1st.com/VENUE} where VENUE is replaced with the
shortname of your venue.  That is, a URL shown in the table as
\emph{/store}, for the fictitious Silver Start Theater  whose shortname
assigned by A1~Patron Systems is \verb+silverstar+, really expands to
\url{http://www.audience1st.com/silverstar/store} 

\begin{table}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|p{0.75\textwidth}}
    \hline
    \textbf{URL} & \textbf{Where it goes} \\
    \hline
    /customers/login  & Login page for subscribers and returning
    customers \\
    /store & Default page for buying individual tickets \\
    /store?showdate\_id=\emph{id} & Purchase individual tickets with
    performance preselected to the performance whose showdate ID is \emph{id}.
    You can determine the showdate ID by going to the \emph{Shows} tab
    and clicking on the name of a show. \\
    /store?show\_id=\emph{id} & Purchase individual tickets with
    production preselected to the show whose show ID is \emph{id}, but
    no specific performance preselected.  Show
    ID's are shown to the left of each show name when you click the
    \emph{Shows} tab. \\
    /store/subscribe & Page for purchasing subscriptions for the current
    season.  If no such subscriptions are still on sale, patron will
    simply be redirected to the page for regular ticket purchase. \\
  \end{tabular}
\label{table:links}
\caption{External links directly pointing to Audience1st.  Replace
  \smallcaps{venue} with the shortname of your venue in all examples.}
\end{table}

\subsection{RSS Feed}
\label{sec:rss}

\af provides an RSS feed of upcoming performances, where each feed item
includes a one-line description of the performance's sales volume
(``Available,'' ``Nearly sold out,'' or ``Sold out'') and is a link to
the ticket-purchase page preselected for that performance (sold-out
shows don't include a link).

The RSS feed is compatible with most popular content-management or blog
software that includes an RSS feed plug-in.  The feed returns one item
for each upcoming show in the calendar season, so if you want to display
fewer, you'll have to configure your RSS plug-in or widget accordingly.

The URL at which the feed is available is
\url{http://www.audience1st.com/VENUE/info/ticket_rss}.

\subsection{Show Calendar}
\label{sec:calendar}

\af exports the calendar of all upcoming performances for the calendar
season in the standard vCalendar format.  This makes it suitable for
subscribing to the calendar from any plug-in or application (e.g. iCal
on Mac OS~X, Outlook 2003 or later) that can subscribe to a
vCalendar-format calendar.  It also makes it easy to display a ``season
calendar'' on your venue's Web site by using a plug-in that understands
the vCalendar format.

The URL at which the calendar is available is
\url{http://www.audience1st.com/VENUE/info/calendar_ical}.

\subsection{CSS Designer's Guide}
\label{sec:creating_css}

This section is provided for designers familiar with the Cascading
Stylesheets (CSS) standard for visual design of Web pages.  It contains
the necessary information to style the \af pages to match a venue's
existing Web site.

(Section TBD)

Any images (e.g. background pictures) or other resources used by the CSS
must be hosted on the venue's own web site or another external site, and
fully-qualified URL's must be used to name them.  (The URL of the main
stylesheet itself is settable as a configuration option of \af; see
section~\ref{sec:config-vars}.)
