Feature: quick donation without logging in

  As the development manager
  To make it easier for people to donate
  I want to provide a way to donate with a credit card without logging in

Scenario: donor logged in, so page gets prepopulated

Scenario: donor not logged in but has matching account

Scenario: donor not logged in and no previous account
