Feature: link with Facebook

  As a patron who has a Facebook account
  I want to link my Audience1st account with Facebook
  So that I can avoid remembering 2 logins and see which of my friends
    are attending shows

Scenario: login from Facebook

  Given I am logged in via Facebook as "Armando Fox"
  And I am on the home page
