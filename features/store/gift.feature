Feature: Gift checkout

  As a customer
  So that I can gift tickets
  I want to checkout with gift tickets

Background:
  Given customer "Tom Foolery" exists with email "joe3@yahoo.com"
  And I am logged in as customer "Tom Foolery"
  And my gift order contains the following tickets:
    | show    | qty | type    | price | showdate             |
    | Chicago |   2 | General |  7.00 | May 15, 2010, 8:00pm |
  And the following customers exist:
    | first_name | last_name | email           | created_by_admin | street        | password | password_confirmation | city | state |   zip | last_login          | updated_at | 
    | John       | Lennon    | john@lennon.com | false            | Imagine St.   | imagine  | imagine               | Berk | CA    | 99999 | 2009-01-01          | 2009-01-01 |       
  And I go to the store page
 
Scenario: Allow gift purchase if logged in and approved by box office manager
  Given the setting "allow gift tickets" is "true"
  And I go to the store page
  Then I should see "This order is a gift" 

Scenario: Prohibit gift purchase if logged in but unapproved by box office manager
  Given the setting "allow gift tickets" is "false"
  And I go to the store page
  Then I should not see "This order is a gift"
