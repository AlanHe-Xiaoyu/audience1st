# General

disable_admin: >
  
  Lets you switch between viewing the site with admin privileges vs. how
  a regular patron would see it.  

# Logging in

login_using_facebook: >

  This feature lets you use your existing Facebook username and password
  to login rather than remembering a separate username and password.  Your
  Facebook password is never revealed to us, and we only use your Facebook
  information to log you in and tell you which of your friends are
  attending shows and who has "Liked" shows.  If you already have a
  username and password with us, login with those and then click "Link
  my account to Facebook" on the welcome page after logging in.

# Store pages

credit_card_verification_value: >

  The CVV (security) code consists of the last three digits of the
  number printed on the BACK of your card, toward the right edge of the
  signature panel. 

skip_validation: >

  Checking this box, which is invisible to regular customers, skips
  certain credit card prevalidations (including CVV checking) 
  normally performed
  before sending the transaction to Authorize.net.  Check this box at
  your own risk!

# Show/showdate setup pages

max_advance_sales: >

  The maximum allowed advance sales/reservations for this performance,
  which may be less than the show's house capacity (specified
  as part of the overall show information).  If this number is
  zero, or is greater than the actual house capacity, the actual house
  capacity will be used.  The ticket availability shown to customers
  (when they self-purchase/reserve, or via the RSS feed) is based on
  this number, so a show whose max advance sales is 100 will report
  "sold out" when 100 tickets are sold, even if the physical house
  capacity has been set higher than 100.

# Customers and customer lists

customer_labels: >

  You can 'tag' customers with labels of your choice, such as Volunteer,
  Merchant Partner, etc.  Labels can then be used in report generation.

filter_by_zip: >

  Patterns that match the start of a zip code, separated by
  commas. '945,946'  matches anything starting with 945 or 946.  '94'
  matches anything starting with 94.  '94,925' matches anything starting
  with 94 or anything starting with 925, etc.

merge_customers: >

  To merge duplicates, select exactly 2 customer records.  Merging
  manually lets you choose which field values are retained; merging
  automatically retains all nonblank field values, breaking ties by
  preferring the customer record that has had the most recent activity.

delete_customers: > 

  When you Forget a customer, all their transactions (donations, purchases,
  etc.) are transferred to the 'Anonymous Customer', so sales reporting is
  unaffected.  If you Expunge a customer, their transactions are also
  deleted: you are re-writing history as if this customer had never
  existed, making them an un-person.  Neither action can be undone.

# Importing

import_show_name:  >
 
  Because the format of will-call lists varies, you have to specify
  which show this is for.  If it doesn't exist, enter the name of a new
  show, which will be automatically created in order to import the
  list.  NOTE!  If you enter a new show name, that show will be created 
  even if the import is aborted or fails.

import_choose_file:  >

  Each kind of import expects a specific file type and layout.  If these
  files are CSV (comma-separated values), be sure they have been saved
  as "Windows CSV".  Some imports also accept other file types.

check_for_duplicates_after_import: >
  
  When automatically importing customers (such as from an external
  will-call list or spreadsheet), Audience1st cannot always tell for
  sure if two customers with similar names are duplicates.  After doing
  any kind of import, you should check for duplicates (Reports tab, under
  Database Maintenance reports) and use your judgment in merging them.
  It's best to do duplicate elimination as soon as possible, since
  duplicate records sometimes prevent customers from being able to login.

# Bulk importing

bulk_download_login: >

  Enter the username and password you'd use to login to the "Producer"
  account for this vendor (the account that lets you download sales
  reports). 

# Editing shows and showdates

show_or_showdate_description: >

  You can add an optional short description to a show (e.g. 
  "Not included in subscription") or a performance (e.g. "Preview") 
  which will appear in the customer-facing dropdown menus.

show_house_capacity: >

  The true (physical) capacity of the house for this production, used
  for reporting purposes to answer questions like "What fraction of all
  seats available were actually filled", useful when applying for
  royalty licenses.  You MUST enter a number greater than zero
  here, or all performances will appear to be sold out.
  You can separately set the  maximum advance sales allowed for each
  performance.

show_listing_date: >
 
  The date the show will appear on any customer-facing screens.  Note
  that you also need to set the "Start Sales" and "End Sales" dates for
  each performance.

show_landing_page_url: >

  The URL of a page on your theater's Web site that has more information
  about the show.

show_is_special: >

  Check this box if this event isn't really a regular show but is some
  other product (acting class, sponsorship opportunity, etc.)  Shows
  marked this way will NOT appear on the regular ticket sales page, but
  will appear only on the Special Products page
  (https://www.audience1st.com/your_venue_name/store/special).  

# Vouchers and voucher types

vouchertype_type: >

  A Bundle is a container for a collection of vouchers (e.g. a
  subscription).  A Single Subscriber Voucher is a voucher valid for a
  particular production included as part of a subscription (although
  Bundles can contain both Single Subscriber Vouchers and comps).  All
  other types of tickets that aren't comps are Revenue Vouchers.
  Nonticket Product can be used for things like ticket exchange fees,
  ticket add-ons ("A glass of wine at intermission"), etc.

vouchertype_account_code: >

  If you use accounting software such as QuickBooks, sales of each
  voucher type can be associated with a particular account code when you
  generate reports.  If you don't use such software, you can leave this
  blank.

vouchertype_season: >

  The season during which this voucher type is valid.  The season start
  date is based on the value you provide under the Admin options.

vouchertype_availability: >

  Use "External Reseller" for tickets that will be sold through other
  channels such as TBA, Goldstar, etc.  Use "Box Office Use Only" for
  tickets that cannot be self-purchased online by customer (for example,
  special group sales).

vouchertype_fulfillment_needed: >

  If purchasing this ticket type requires physically mailing something
  to the customer (e.g., mailing a subscription package or free gift),
  check this box.  This will cause all such orders to appear in the
  "Show Orders Needing Fulfillment" report (Reports tab).

vouchertype_walkup_sale_allowed: >

  If this box is checked, this ticket type will appear on the Walk-up
  Sales screen.  Leave unchecked for any ticket types that require
  advance purchase.

vouchertype_changeable: >

  If checked, customer can change/cancel a reservation associated with
  this voucher type online WITH NO FEE.  If you want to allow
  changes/cancellations for a fee, leave this box UNCHECKED and create a
  separate Nonticket Product voucher for box office use only
  corresponding to the change fee.  (At this time, the box office must
  handle such transactions.)

vouchertype_bundle_promo_code:  >

  A promo code (password) required to purchase; this bundle type
  won't be visible as a choice in dropdown menu until customer enters the
  promo code.  To specify multiple allowable promo codes, separate them
  by commas.  If blank, no promo code is required to purchase this
  bundle. 

# Donations

donation_search_by_letter_sent: >

  When viewing donations, you can mark off all the ones for which you
  have sent an acknowledgment letter.  Checking this box restricts your
  search to donations not yet acknowledged, making it easy to export a
  list of all the donation letters you have to send.

# Reports

sublists: >

  Sublists are named subsets of your master email list as maintained by
  Mailchimp or ConstantContact.  By saving the result of a report as a
  sublist, you can then send an email campaign to just those patrons.

# Box office

checkin: >

  Click a number in this column to "check in" that many people in the 
  customer's party as they arrive.  
  A highlighted number indicates people who have
  checked in.  
  Click the X to "un-check-in" everyone in that customer's party.
