# Store pages

credit_card_verification_value: >

  The CVV (security) code consists of the last three digits of the
  number printed on the BACK of your card, toward the right edge of the
  signature panel. 

# Show/showdate setup pages

max_advance_sales: >

  The maximum allowed advance sales/reservations for this performance,
  which may be less than the show's house capacity.  If this number is
  zero (or is greater than the house capacity), the actual house
  capacity will be used.

# Customers and customer lists

filter_by_zip: >

  Patterns that match the start of a zip code, separated by
  commas. '945,946'  matches anything starting with 945 or 946.  '94'
  matches anything starting with 94.  '94,925' matches anything starting
  with 94 or anything starting with 925, etc.

merge_customers: >

  To merge duplicates, select exactly 2 customer records.  Merging
  manually lets you choose which field values are retained; merging
  automatically retains all nonblank field values, breaking ties by
  preferring the customer record that has had the most recent activity.

delete_customers: > 

  When you delete a customer, all their transactions, donations,
  etc. are transferred to the 'Anonymous Customer' and the customer
  record is expunged.  This action cannot be undone. 

# Editing shows and showdates

show_or_showdate_description: >

  You can add an optional short description to a show (e.g. 
  "Not included in subscription") or a performance (e.g. "Preview") 
  which will appear in the customer-facing dropdown menus.

show_house_capacity: >

  The physical capacity of the house for this production, which is used
  to help box office staff keep track of the number of open seats
  remaining during front-of-house (pre-show).  The actual number of
  seats you offer for sale can be different: for each performance, if
  you enter a value for Max Sales, it will override this number.  Note
  that you MUST enter a nonzero number here or all performances will
  appear to be sold out.

show_listing_date: >
 
  The date the show will appear on any customer-facing screens.  Note
  that you also need to set the "Start Sales" and "End Sales" dates for
  each performance.

show_landing_page_url: >

  The URL of a page on your theater's Web site that has more information
  about the show.

# Vouchers and voucher types

vouchertype_type: >

  A Bundle is a container for a collection of vouchers (e.g. a
  subscription).  A Single Subscriber Voucher is a voucher valid for a
  particular production included as part of a subscription (although
  Bundles can contain both Single Subscriber Vouchers and comps).  All
  other types of tickets that aren't comps are Revenue Vouchers.
  Nonticket Product can be used for things like ticket exchange fees,
  ticket add-ons ("A glass of wine at intermission"), etc.

vouchertype_account_code: >

  If you use accounting software such as QuickBooks, sales of each
  voucher type can be associated with a particular account code when you
  generate reports.  If you don't use such software, you can leave this
  blank.

vouchertype_availability: >

  Use "External Reseller" for tickets that will be sold through other
  channels such as TBA, Goldstar, etc.  Use "Box Office Use Only" for
  tickets that cannot be self-purchased online by customer (for example,
  special group sales).

vouchertype_fulfillment_needed: >

  If purchasing this ticket type requires physically mailing something
  to the customer (e.g., mailing a subscription package or free gift),
  check this box.  This will cause all such orders to appear in the
  "Show Orders Needing Fulfillment" report (Reports tab).

vouchertype_walkup_sale_allowed: >

  If this box is checked, this ticket type will appear on the Walk-up
  Sales screen.  Leave unchecked for any ticket types that require
  advance purchase.

# Donations

donation_search_by_letter_sent: >

  When viewing donations, you can mark off all the ones for which you
  have sent an acknowledgment letter.  Checking this box restricts your
  search to donations not yet acknowledged, making it easy to export a
  list of all the donation letters you have to send.
